A reference could be considered:#to be like de-referencing a pointer#^a safer version of a pointer#a less safe version of a pointer#to hold the value of an object directly
If a class you write owns resources, it needs a#vector#^destructor#stack#virtual member function
A reference can be considered#a mention of some coder in the press#^a pointer that is immutable and automatically de-referenced#an array that is automatically indexed
<code>x = d[-3];</code> would be valid C++ when dealing with#a vector#a double#^an array
