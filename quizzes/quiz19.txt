When writing an assignment operator overload, why do we return *this?#^Because in C++, assignment returns a value.#Because we want to draw attention to the object that was assigned to.#Because we need to tell the compiler what object we are assigning to.
Why don't we add new memory to our vector's storage on every call to <code>push_back()</code>?#Because the system won't let us make that many calls to <code>malloc</code>.#^Because it costs a lot of CPU cycles to do that.#Because we are lazy, and don't want to write that much code.
