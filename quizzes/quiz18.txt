A good use of shallow copying would be when#^we have a very large object to copy#we just need to scoop out the top few values from an object#we don't really care if all the field values are the same
A good use of deep copying would be when#we need to make sure the values in one object change when values in the other do#^we need to make sure each objects uses separate memory#we need to save memory
We want a default constructor when#^we can establish meaningful invariants using default values#we really don't know what should initialize a class#we want to eliminate the faults (defaults) from our classes
We need a destructor when our class#has many members#has default values#has no copy constructor#^acquires resources
